# pslanschoolair-blocker
a stupid lanschool air blocker i quickly made in powershell

this was made for people in my school only, but this *should* work for anyone else with lanschool air on their pc, just make sure you have access to powershell

instructions:
1. download the blocker(its the one named lsairblocker.ps1)
2. to run it, DO NOT DOUBLE CLICK IT LIKE ANY OTHER FILE, right click on it and click "Run with Powershell".
3. you're all set!

please note that if it says error most of the time, and sometimes it says "SUCCESS: The process "LSAirClient.exe with PID" blah blah blah, that means its working.
