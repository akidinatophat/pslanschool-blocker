# pslanschoolair-blocker
welcome to the batch file branch! if powershell does not work for some reason, you can alternatively use this batch file fork of the blocker.

instructions:

1. instead of going to releases(which is reserved only for official powershell releases), go to the code and download it.
2. extract the batch file from the zip and save it somewhere
3. double click to run


disclaimer: this fork will not be updated as often as the powershell edition
